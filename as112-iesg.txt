This is a document shpherd write-up of draft-ietd-dnsop-as112-dname-03,
structured according to the requirements of RFC 4858 and following
the corresponding template dated 24 February 2012.

1) 

   Requested status is Informational.

   This document describes an approach for mitigating a key deficiency
   in the existing ("Direct Delegation") model of AS112 deployment
   that makes use of DNAME, namely the difficulty in adding or
   dropping particular zones from the AS112 infrastructure.

   The use of DNAME for this purpose is novel, and while some
   experiments (as described in this document) have indicated
   widespread support across the Internet for DNAME and have confirmed
   that the approach is functionally feasible, DNAME has not been
   previously used for AS112 in the wild. Note that the document
   does not propose immediate refactoring of the direct delegation
   approach for existing zones sunk in the AS112 infrastructure.

   Given the experimental aspects of this approach the document
   shepherd and the authors are not opposed to Experimental status.
   However, the document shepherd feels that Informational is
   preferred given plausible indications that the dependent mechanism
   (i.e. DNAME) are well-defined, well-deployed and suitable for
   the purpose.

Technical Summary

   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses
   that are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses
   designated in RFC 1918 for private use within individual sites.

   Devices in such environments may occasionally originate Domain
   Name System (DNS) queries (so-called "reverse lookups") corresponding
   to those private-use addresses.  Since the addresses concerned
   have only local significance, it is good practice for site
   administrators to ensure that such queries are answered locally.
   However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal
   delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered
   within the site.

   It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers
   to such queries.  In addition, due to the wide deployment of
   private-use addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet,
   the volume of such queries is large and growing.  The AS112
   project aims to provide a distributed sink for such queries in
   order to reduce the load on the IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative
   servers.  The AS112 project is named after the Autonomous System
   Number (ASN) that was assigned to it.

   The AS112 project does not accommodate the addition and removal
   of DNS zones elegantly.  Since additional zones of definitively
   local significance are known to exist, this presents a problem.
   This document describes modifications to the deployment and use
   of AS112 infrastructure that will allow zones to be added and
   dropped much more easily.

Working Group Summary

   There were no notable outcomes from the WG process or in the
   working-group last call. The dnsop working group chair observed
   strong consensus on the text and the approach described by the
   text following presentations and discussion on the mailing list
   and in multiple in-person meetings.

Document Quality

   The document describes the use of protocols that are already
   defined and implemented to augment AS112 infrastructure. The
   approach was validated by experiment, and an abridged summary
   of that experiment and its results are included in the document.

   The Acknowledgements section of the diagram does not omit to
   mention any significant reviewer.

   The working group review included input from participants with
   significant DNS protocol and operations expertise, and in the
   opionion of this document shepherd and the working group chairs
   no additional expert consultation is required.

Personnel:
   The document shepherd is Tim Wicinski.

   The dnsop working group chairs are Tim Wicinski and Suzanne
   Woolf.

   The responsible area director is Joel Jaeggli.

3)
   The document shepherd reviewed this document for clarity, potential
   for ambiguity or self-contradiction, technical accuracy and
   operational impact.

   It is the document shepherd's opinion that this document is ready
   to forward to the IESG.

4) 
   The document shepherd has no such concern.

5)
   In the opinion of the document shepherd, no further or wider review
   is necessary.

6)
   The document shepherd has no such concern and has identified no
   such issue.

7)
   No IPR disclosures have been made for this document.

   The authors have indicated that no IPR disclosures are intended
   to be made.

   The document shepherd has identified no reasons for an IPR
   disclosure to be made.

8)
   No such IPR disclosure has been made.

9)
   The document shepherd and dnsop working group chairs have identified
   strong working group consensus for this document to proceed.

   The document has been discussed at some length on the dnsop mailing
   list and has also been presented in multiple face-to-face meetings.

10)
   The document shepherd and working group chairs are aware of no
   such threat or discontent.

11)   No I-D nits have been identified by the document shepherd.

12)
   No such formal review is required for this document.

13)
   All references have been identified as either normative or
   informative.

14)
   This document contains a normative reference to
   draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc6304bis which is being submitted to the IESG
   in a bundle with this document.  The document shepherd suggests
   that both documents be considered by the IESG together, since
   they reference each other. Following direction from the IESG to
   proceed, both documents would most naturally proceed through the
   publication process together.

15)
   There are no downward normative references.

16)
   Publication of this document will not change the status of any
   existing RFC.

17)
   The document shepherd has been informed by the authors that the
   IANA Considerations section has already been informally reviewed
   by IANA staff, and that changes informally suggested have been
   implemented.

   All number resource assignments and directions relating to the
   delegation of a zone from the ARPA TLD have been confirmed (again,
   informally) to be clear and actionable.

   No new registries are requested by this document.

   The use of a name under the ARPA TLD requires IAB approval, per
   RFC 3172. This document includes an IAB Considerations section
   that is sufficient to request and document the IAB's review, in
   the opinion of the document shepherd.

18)
   No new registries are requested by this document.

19)
   This document contains no such section.
