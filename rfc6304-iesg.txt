  == Missing Reference: 'THIS DOCUMENT' is mentioned on line 793, but not
     defined
  This is in the table under IANA Actions section.

  -- Obsolete informational reference (is this intentional?): RFC 5735
     (Obsoleted by RFC 6890)

  This does seem to be an issue, though the original document referenced the older RFC.

(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review
criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

13) 
   All references have been identified as either normative or
   informative.

14)
  There is a reference to a document ietf-dnsop-as112-dname which is being submitted to the IESF in a bundle with this document. The document shepherd suggests both documents be considered for the IESG together, since they reference each other.  Following direction from the IESG to
  proceed, both documents would most naturally proceed through the
  publication process together.


15) 
  There are no downward normative references.

16)
  Publication of this document will obsolute RFC6304.

17)

(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations
section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the
document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes
are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.
Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly
identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a
detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that
allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a
reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see RFC 5226).

(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future
allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find
useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.

(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document
Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal
language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.
